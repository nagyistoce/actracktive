Actracktive

BUILDING
================================================================================

1. Build Requirements
---------------------

Actracktive has been built/tested on the following systems:

 * Mac OSX 10.6.8, Apple GCC 4.2.1
 * Ubuntu 12.04, GNU GCC 4.6.1

It depends on several libraries, which are required at build time and usually at
runtime as well, if no explicit static linking is done. All build configurations
require the following libraries:

 * boost (>= 1.46.0)
 * dc1394 (>= 2.1.3)
 * freetype (>= 2.4.4)
 * log4cplus (>= 1.0.3)
 * opencv (>= 2.3.0)
    - tbb 4.0, dependency of opencv
    - z 1.2.6, dependency of opencv

Compiling on OSX additionally requires:

 * CoreFoundation.framework
 * OpenGL.framework
 * GLUT.framework
 * QTKit.framework

Compiling on Linux additionally requires:

 * GL
 * GLU
 * freeglut (>= 2.6.0)


2. Build Setup
--------------

### 2.1 OSX

Install the required libraries using MacPorts:

    $ sudo port install boost libdc1394 freetype log4cplus opencv tbb zlib

Change the launchd configuration, so that it will find the libraries installed
via MacPorts. Open the file `/etc/launchd.conf` and add the following line:

    setenv DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH $DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/local/lib

For command line support, also add the following to the file /etc/profile:

    export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH:/opt/local/lib

A system restart (or at least logout/login) is required for the new settings to
become effective.

### 2.2 Linux

Install the required libraries using a package manager, for example apt on
Ubuntu 12.04:

    $ apt-get install libboost-dev libdc1394-22-dev libfreetype6-dev \
      liblog4cplus-dev libopencv-dev libtbb-dev zlib1g-dev


3. Building using Eclipse CDT
-----------------------------

Select the appropriate build configuration, depending on the platform:

 * Linux Debug
 * Linux Release
 * OSX Debug
 * OSX Release

Start building by choosing "Build Project" from the "Project" menu. The runnable
binary/application bundle will be placed in the `bin` directory. Additionally,
a distributable package following the naming scheme
`projectname-version-platform.[zip|tar.gz]` is created in the `dist` directory.
